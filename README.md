🔋 Forecasting EV Charging Load: A Machine Learning Approach to Smart Energy ManagementOverviewThis project implements a machine learning and optimization solution for managing Electric Vehicle (EV) charging powered by Solar Photovoltaic (PV) energy within a microgrid.The solution utilizes predictive modeling to forecast key energy metrics, enabling the creation of optimal charging schedules. The main objectives are to maximize the use of locally generated renewable energy (solar PV) and significantly reduce grid energy costs and strain.Project ContextThe integration of rapidly growing EV fleets with intermittent renewable sources like solar PV poses significant grid management challenges. This project addresses the critical need for smart energy management by providing predictive intelligence to balance supply (PV generation) and highly variable demand (EV charging load).💡 Core FeaturesFeatureDescriptionData Analysis & ModelingComprehensive data exploration, feature engineering, and implementation of the XGBoost Regressor model for high-accuracy load forecasting. All analysis is detailed in the Jupyter Notebook.Energy ForecastingPredictions for essential metrics, including: Solar Power, EV Charging Demand, and Total Load on the microgrid.Optimization FrameworkThe model outputs are designed to inform optimization strategies, such as predicting the Optimal_Charging_Decision to regulate demand based on real-time energy costs and grid constraints.Interactive Web ApplicationA Flask API (app.py) serves a simple HTML frontend (index.html) that allows users to input current grid parameters and receive a real-time forecasted EV load.ReproducibilityFull dataset, cleaned data, and the trained model are provided for transparent and reproducible results.💻 Technical StackCategoryTools & LibrariesLanguagePython 3.7+Data Sciencepandas, numpy, scikit-learn, XGBoostVisualizationmatplotlib, seaborn (used within the notebook)DeploymentFlask (for the web API), joblib (for model serialization)DocumentationJupyter Notebook (MLProject.ipynb)🚀 Getting StartedFollow these steps to clone the repository and run the project on your local machine.1. PrerequisitesYou must have Git and Python 3.7+ installed. Using Anaconda or Miniconda is recommended for environment management.2. Cloning the RepositoryOpen your command prompt or terminal and clone the project:Bashgit clone https://github.com/kaviyavarshini08/AI-and-ML
cd AI-and-ML
3. InstallationIt is best practice to create and activate a virtual environment before installing libraries:Bash# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv ev_ml_env
source ev_ml_env/Scripts/activate  # Use 'source ev_ml_env/bin/activate' on Linux/Mac

# Install all necessary packages
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost joblib flask
⚙️ Usage InstructionsThe project runs in two phases: Analysis (in Jupyter) and Application (the Flask web app).Phase 1: Running the Analysis NotebookThis step allows you to review the data, see the model training, and generate the necessary model file (xgb_best_model.pkl).Launch Jupyter Notebook:Bashjupyter notebook
Open the Notebook: In the browser that opens, click on MLProject.ipynb.Execute Cells: Run all cells in the notebook sequentially. This will:Load and preprocess the PV_EV_Charging_Dataset.csv.Train the XGBoost Regressor model.Evaluate its performance.Save the final, trained model as xgb_best_model.pkl.Phase 2: Running the Web Application FrontendThis step launches the interactive demonstration where you can input parameters and receive a prediction from your trained model.Stop Jupyter: Return to the terminal and press Ctrl + C twice to shut down the Jupyter server.Start the Flask Server:Bashpython app.py
Access the App: The terminal will display a running address (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000/). Open this link in your web browser.Test Prediction: Interact with the form to input features like Solar_Power_kW, Battery_SOC_%, Energy_Cost_$/kWh, etc., and click the predict button to see the forecasted EV load visualized on the chart.📁 Repository ContentsFile NameDescriptionMLProject.ipynbThe main analysis file.
